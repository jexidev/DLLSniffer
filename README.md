# ðŸ§ª DLLSniffer
**DLLSniffer** is a lightweight PowerShell utility that scans `.dll` files in your game setup folders and outputs a detailed report to Excel. Whether you're organizing downloads with BinSnatcher or just want to verify the integrity of your files, DLLSniffer adds a layer of trust to your workflow.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does
- Scans a user-defined folder for `.dll` files
- Extracts metadata like file name, path, size, and creation date
- Outputs results to a clean Excel spreadsheet
- Confirms scan completion and shows where the file was saved

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Run the script in PowerShell or VS Code.
2. The script will prompt you for an output file path. Enter your desired location and press Enter:
   "Please enter the full path to save the Excel report (e.g., C:\Reports\ScanResults.xlsx)"
3. DLLSniffer will then scan the predefined system folders, save the report, and attempt to open it in Excel.
